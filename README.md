# ConvaiBox

An A.I. chatbot package for NLP exploration, web app widgets, and any situation that calls for a plug and play chatbot.
The chatbot is powered by [Hugging Faces](https://huggingface.co/)' implementation of the neural network [GPT](https://openai.com/blog/language-unsupervised/), 
the language model HuggingFace used in a dialogue competition at NeurIPS 2018, Conversational Intelligence Challenge 2 (ConvAI2). 

## Installation

Run/do the following after repository, python, and elixir download from project root.
<ol>
<li>Create virtual environment: py -m venv env</li>
<li>Activate virtual environment: .\env\Scripts\activate</li>
<li>pip install -r requirements.txt</li>
</ol>

## Enviornment
I attempted to make this as portable as possible, but installing the various dependencies that power the Hugging Face and 
PyTorch libraries has proven problematic.
In case of complication, current system details are given below.
